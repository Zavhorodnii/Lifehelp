			<h2>Information Lifehelp May Share</h2>
			<p>We keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies or during an emergency circumstance as judged by your Therapist working with local authorities).

			<h2>The Uses of the Collected Data by Lifehelp</h2>
			<p>Lifehelp uses non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and to use in research and trend analysis. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a site survey or form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. We only provide data to our partners, if any, after we have removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people’s data in a way that it no longer personally identifies you.
				Lifehelp uses non-identifying and aggregate information about responses to the clinical outcome assessments (personal assessments), and the frequency of the utilization of the Lifehelp service. These efforts enhance program evaluation.
				The anonymous and aggregated data also may be published through various media platforms/academic journals. No personal identifying information is tied to the results, and Lifehelp does not share anything that could be used to identify your account or your private information.
				From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.

Lifehelp may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services. Lifehelp may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services.

Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some forms of processing (sending promotional information, commercial profiling, behavioral advertising, geo-location, etc.) may require the express consent of the User.

			<h2>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Use And Disclosure Of Personal Data</h2>
			<p>Lifehelp recognizes that California has articulated specific privacy rights of Lifehelp Users in that State. California Users should understand that Lifehelp does not sell User data to third parties. Further, Lifehelp is a medical records retention company. As such, almost all User data is kept in encrypted storage as a medical record, including all User created transcripts. State Law requires Lifehelp to retain such records for at least seven years. The CCPA does not generally apply to medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or protected health information collected by a covered entity or business associate governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009. Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request, once a year, if Lifehelp have shared their personal information (non medical record data only) with other companies for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. This is California’s “Shine-the-Light Law.”  To request a copy of the information disclosure provided by Lifehelp, please contact us on Lifehelp.co at the “contact us” link on the website. Please allow reasonable time for a response. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted on our site. Lifehelp does not have User below the age of 13 and does not typically allow Users to publicly post information. However, if you feel you publicly posted information on the Site and you are between the ages of 13 and 17, please contact us on  Lifehelp.co at the “contact us” link on the website. Please allow reasonable time for a response. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the data/content you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or even allow removal of data, specifically medical data, even if requested. California Right to Know: You may request access to the specific pieces of personal data we have collected about you in the last 12 months. You may also request additional details about our information practices, including the categories of personal data we have collected about you, the sources of such collection, the categories of personal data we share for a business or commercial purpose, and the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal data. You may make these requests by contacting  us on Lifehelp.co at the “contact us” link on the website. Please allow reasonable time for a response. California Designated Agent. You may designate an agent to make a request on your behalf. That agent must have access to your account in order for us to verify the request. California Non-Discrimination. Lifehelp will never discriminate against you, including by denying or providing a different level of service should you choose to exercise your rights  under the CCPA.</p>
			<h2>Privacy in International Use and The GDPR</h2>
			<p>The Lifehelp Platform advises both its Client/Users and practicing Platform Providers to be aware of and respect and comply with the local laws of any international based Client. Lifehelp is cognizant and respects the formal promulgation of the existing European Union (EU) data privacy regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA and is commonly referred to as “GDPR.” Lifehelp has always respected our Client’s Privacy (see our Privacy Policy) and we were already a HIPAA certified platform following stringent data privacy rules. The basic tenants of the promulgated GDPR regulations include, but are not limited to the following: Disclosure when you sell, transfer or third party marketing of User’s data: As outlined in this Terms of Use, Lifehelp does not sell or transfer Client data and any marketing efforts are focused solely on internal information updates to our registered Clients. Access to collected data: At Lifehelp, you already have the ability to access your shared data (Your personal information, your emergency contact information and all your interactions with your Providers) and use it as you wish. Clear Consent: At Lifehelp our Terms of Use are clear on what consent we seek with regards to your data and prior to your engagement with your Provider, you review and agree to a further “informed consent” process. Security: At Lifehelp we have encrypted our data from day one and has always been stored all Private Health Information with full HIPAA compliance and in an anonymized form as required by the GDPR. Notice/Audit: At Lifehelp, we will provide our Clients notice of any data breach and we employ a full time security Officer, as well as engaging a third party security firm to periodically audit both or code and technology security as well as our HIPAA policies and procedures around data security. Finally, dependent of your EU country or origin, the GDPR takes into account what was previously termed the right “to forget” or request deletion of your data once you cease using a particular application or site. This particular tenant of the GDPR may conflict with applicable medical records retention laws. In the United States, this requires at least seven years of retention, which is common around the world and is sometime up to ten years or more in certain countries. So, unlike some data platforms, Lifehelp cannot erase private health data directly upon a Client’s request, as it may be considered essential for other medical file retention purposes. Applicable individual country medical retention laws are generally considered an acceptable exception to the GDPR regulations regarding the right to deletion of certain data.</p>
