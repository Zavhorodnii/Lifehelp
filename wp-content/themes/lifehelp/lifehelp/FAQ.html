										<p>The mission of Lifehelp is to make therapy accessible and affordable for everyone. We aim to provide more people with a convenient way to contact licensed therapists who can help those in need to make their life happier.</p>

										<p>When using Lifehelp, you can send a Counselor text, audio, picture, and video messages in a private chat room. Lifehelp stands out because of the affordability and availability it provides.</p>
										<p>Lifehelp is the largest online counseling platform worldwide. We change the way people get help in dealing with their issues by making professional counseling available anytime and anywhere. Lifehelp provides convenient, safe, and affordable access to services of licensed therapists using a computer, tablet, or smartphone.</p>

										<p>Lifehelp is right for everyone who wants to improve the quality of their life. We can help you if there is anything that interferes with your happiness or prevents you from achieving your goals or does not give you peace of mind. Besides, we have counselors who are specialized in specific issues, such as stress, depression, anxiety, self-esteem, parenting, relationships, addictions, eating disorders, family conflicts, trauma, abuse, anger, LGBT, grief, and more.</p>

Nevertheless, while the service may have similar benefits, it's not capable of replacing traditional face-to-face therapy in every case. Please turn your attention to the fact that your Counselor won't be able to make any official diagnosis, to fulfill any court order or prescribe medication.</p>

Counselors have different approaches, methods, and areas of focus. That is why it's essential to find the right person to achieve the best results for you. We want to note that our service is able to provide a successful match most of the time. However, you may elect to be matched to a different counselor if you think that your Counselor isn't a good fit for you.</p>

										<p>All the Counselors on Lifehelp are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D. / PsyD), clinical social workers (LCSW / LMSW), marriage and family therapists (LMFT), or licensed professional counselors (LPC). They all have a Masters Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state's professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training, and practice. Their experience, expertise, and background may vary, but they all possess at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience. </p>

									<div class="sub-menu__link">
										<p>Certainly! On Lifehelp we have a huge, nationwide network of licensed therapists. All the therapists have been carefully checked and verified to provide services on Lifehelp. On our platform there are no interns or therapists who are not fully licensed and still under supervision. We require our therapists to have over 3,000 hours of clinical experience.</p>
										<p>Most of the Lifehelp therapists have additional training in specific approaches to therapy, which include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Existential-Humanistic, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Psychodynamic, Mindfulness, and more.</p>
										<p>Please note that the therapists you work with are licensed in your US state of residence.</p>
										<p>Besides, we also have a Board of Advisors who include prominent professionals that are experts in the healthcare space and help ensure that our service is useful and effective in achieving our goals.</p>

										<p>With the help of our team, we make sure that every provider we bring to the platform is fully licensed and in good standing. Mandatory requirement for therapists who apply is to provide proper licensure documentation, proof of identity, and references from other licensed practitioners who have worked with them. We always cross-check their licensure information with their respective state licensing board.</p>
										<p>Besides, each potential provider needs to complete a case study exam by a licensed clinician and be evaluated in a video interview. After this rigorous 4-5 week process, only about 15% of the therapists who apply to work through Lifehelp are accepted to the platform.</p>
										<p>On Lifehelp, you'll find the full licensing information for each provider so that you could do your own due diligence on your Counselor.</p>

										<p>Lifehelp seeks to ensure everyone the best possible experience with our platform and Counselors. At any time, you can request a new Counselor if you consider that this one doesn't fit you or you're not satisfied with their work. You can do it through your account settings.</p>
										<p>Lifehelp acts as a conduit to arrange professional services. Those services are paid to the therapists through their Therapist Agreement with Lifehelp. In general, we do not provide refunds for unused time. Just like other medical professionals, the therapists charge for the time that is scheduled to be used. However, customer service reviews refunds on a case-by-case basis after considering the client’s requests and the therapist’s response. We can work out a compromise in case of unique or legal circumstances (medical, death, disability, court orders, etc.) that may dictate the reason for the refund request. In cases where we cannot provide a refund, we are usually able to make accommodations some other way such as a credit for future service.</p>
										<p>If there is something you believe we could do differently or you have any suggestions on how we can improve your Lifehelp experience, please let us know by contacting us at support@lifehelp.co.</p>
